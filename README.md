# Movie_genre_prediction

This project aims to predict movie genres based on plot summaries. Text understanding starts with the challenge of finding machine-understandable representation that captures the semantics of texts. In this project, we used three of the most commonly used document representations to represent movie plots. To tackle the multi-label classification problem of predicting movie genres, we used methods such as Binary Rel- evance, Classifier chains, Decision Tree Classifier, and BPMLL. Experiments have been conducted and several evaluation metrics have been used to report the results.
